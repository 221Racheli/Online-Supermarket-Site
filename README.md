# Online Supermarket Site

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end online supermarket website developed in 2023. It encompasses database design, server-side and client-side development, and integration of artificial intelligence features. The project was undertaken with a focus on independent learning and engaging with the entire development lifecycle from specification to implementation.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend server development.
- **React**: Frontend development for dynamic user interfaces.
- **Python**: Integration of artificial intelligence features.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MUI (Material-UI)**: React component library for building UIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Authentication mechanism.
- **Sequelize ORM**: Object-relational mapping for MySQL.
- **REST API**: Architecture for building networked applications.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

## Features
- **Database Design**: A well-structured database schema to efficiently manage supermarket-related data such as products, orders, customers, etc.
- **Server-side Development**: Utilization of Node.js with Express for handling server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Client-side Development**: React used for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Artificial Intelligence Integration**: Integration of AI features for tasks like personalized recommendations, inventory management optimization, etc.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: JWT-based authentication for secure access to user-specific features.
- **ORM Usage**: Sequelize ORM employed for simplified interaction with the MySQL database.
- **RESTful API**: Design and implementation of a RESTful API to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Responsive Design**: UI designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
